# Update Devlog

## Current Phase
Identify current sprint time (e.g., T-9h) and tasks completed.

## Process
1. Read `DEVLOG.md` to see current state.
2. Read `todo.json` or current session history for updates.
3. Append new entry under the "Final Sprint" section.
4. Update "Kiro CLI Usage Statistics" and "Challenges & Solutions".

## Reporting Template
```markdown
### [TIME_REMAINING] PHASE_NAME [DURATION]
- **Tasks**:
  - Task 1
  - Task 2
- **Decisions**: Key technical or strategic choices
- **Kiro Usage**: Which prompts were used and how they helped
```

Invoke this with `@update-devlog` whenever a major task is finished.
